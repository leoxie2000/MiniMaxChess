## Instruction
Simply run the test_chess.py to run play the game. Multiple AIs have been initialized to the different players, and the default is running the random AI against the Iterative deepening search Minimax AI with depth 2. These can all be changed for testing purposes. In my own testing, we have every other AI beating the random AI, and Alpha-beta pruning with depth 4 beats the minimax with depth 2, which is expected. Also notice Minimax with depth 3 or above causes a long computational time, and is not recommended.
